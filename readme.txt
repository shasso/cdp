// Design Patterns as Integrators
This is VisualStudio 8 (VS8) solution that contains two folders:
1) DesignPatternsAsIntegrators --this is where a VS8 solution resides
2) CaseStudy-v2 --the catual project that contains the Resort System case study

You need to download both folders in order for the solution to find all of its parts.
You should be able to to build it and play with it.

************ Notes ****************
This is a trivial example that demonstrates how to use two design patterns
to integarte two separately designed components. This example was part of a presentation 
that I presentet at SEI, SATURN 2013 Software Architecture Conference
Minneapolis, MN April 29 to May 3, 2013. The actual presentation and the extended paper that 
descibes the theory behind this code are also uploaded in this folder.
This is work in progress and I have an intention to extend it further.
